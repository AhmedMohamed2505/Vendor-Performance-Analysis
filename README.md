📊 Retail & Wholesale Profitability Analysis
🔍 Business Problem

In the retail and wholesale industry, profitability is not driven by sales volume alone.
Companies often suffer losses due to inefficient pricing, slow inventory turnover, and vendor dependency.

This project analyzes how vendor performance, bulk purchasing strategy, and inventory management impact overall profitability.

Identify underperforming brands requiring pricing or promotional adjustments

Determine top vendors contributing to revenue and gross profit

Analyze the impact of bulk purchasing on unit costs

Evaluate inventory turnover to reduce holding costs

Investigate profitability differences between high and low-performing vendors
